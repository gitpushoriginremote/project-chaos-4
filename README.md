# Project Chaos: The Entropy Engine

## Overview
This is a resource allocation tool designed to prevent corporate stagnation by introducing controlled unpredictability. It assigns high-stakes tasks to random personnel at inconvenient times.

## Known Issues (Junior Dev Notes)
- The sidebar on `app.html` sometimes ignores the laws of physics (z-index/flex issues).
- The 'Deploy Chaos' button in `script.js` is currently a ghost—it doesn't do anything.
- We're hardcoding the team member list. This needs to be dynamic eventually.
